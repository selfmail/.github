## 📝 About

Selfmail is an open source, selfhostable and free email service. We give you the freedom to choose your own domain, aliases and more. All this is completely free (expect for some pro features). We are currently in a private beta with our hosted platform, and looking for early testers to help us improve the service. This is the official organization for Selfmail, the Selfmail products and the official Selfmail clients.

## 📚 Documentation

The official documentation for Selfmail can be found [here](https://docs.selfmail.app). It contains guides, tutorials and API references. Please note, that other services may have different documentation, so please check the the repo of the service you are want to use.

### 👨‍💻 API

Selfmail has a REST API, which can be used to integrate Selfmail with other services or create your own selfmail client. The API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.selfmail.app/api). We are providing an official [client](https://grids.email) for selfmail which you can use as an example to create your own one.
